# Per-Scholas-Capstone-Project-1
Max Conroy's repository for the first capstone project at the Per Scholas DevOps program.

Technical Requirements:
- Smooth transition of code from the version control system to the target environment (testing/staging/production/etc.) while applying all the necessary testing and quality control practices.
- Build a continuous delivery pipeline to deploy an application of your choice.
- Pull code from the repository, build and test the resulting  Docker image.
- Push the containerized application to Docker Hub.
- Configure and set up a Linux-based Kubernetes cluster.  You may use minikube.  If you set up a Kubernetes cluster with virtual machines you will get extra credit.
- Deploy 3 replicas of the application(from DockerHub) using Ansible to your Kubernetes cluster

Reach goals (optional)
- Cloud implementation in AWS(ec2 free tier)/Azure/GCP; develop the integration, delivery, and deployment pipeline in the cloud.
- Implement webhooks or Git/SCM polling
